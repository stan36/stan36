My name is Christopher Dixon and I am a full-stack web3 developer working for dOrg. I have worked on several web3 projects including StakeOnMe and meToken, OVR, Zer0 and others.

 I specialize in smart-contract design and development with a special interest in the potential of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations(DAO's).

I consider myself a CryptoAnarchist as I believe distributed ledger technologies  can be used to decentralize out corruptible seats of power within government and corporate structures.

It is my goal to use web3 technologies to build superior corroboration and coordination tools that out innovate our existing power structures and prove them to be obsolete.
